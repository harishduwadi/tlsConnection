During populating the DB:
    If the site with whom we're trying to establish a tls connection doesn't have any certificate, it will return error.
        Instead need to add a entry like others, and have a expired date in the validity column.

Removing entries from the DB is not properly set up. When should we remove an entry from the DB?
