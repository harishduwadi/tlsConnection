- main will call certbotmanager with db config and parsed xml configuration with list of domains that is available


- certbotmanager should be run every week 
- needs to have a signal interrupt and a clean shutdown when signal interrupt is executed

- Have a option of populating the DB with the xml file
- or run daemon that checks certificate updating

- certbotmanager
    - [Not Needed: Will Update Either Way] Needs to check if the DB is up to date
        - Done by checking the certificates the website currently is using with net connect
        - maybe print the mismatch in the DB in the web
    - Again loop through all the domains listed in the configuration
        - Check which domains needs certificate updating
        - Add the domain to the list of certificate that certbot needs to create
    - Call certbot with the list of domains entries that needs to have a new certificate
    - Update the DB entry with the updated certificates and private key
    - Send the new certificate to the corresponding endpoint agents, where the certificate is replaced
        - wait for a reply from the agent, Either success or failure (w/ timeout)
    - log the result from the agent in the endpoints.
    

Things to Do:
    - WildCard entries aren't handled properly. It just checks the servername currently,
        - Currently we have two wild-card entries *.supplyframe.com and *.enterprise-demo.supplyframe.com
